Task 1: Working on the master branch

When both of us are working on the master branch, we need to pull the updated files from the master branch every time we want to push new changes to the remote repo. 

Task 2: Resolving conflicts

When both of us try to modify one file at the same time, after one person push the changes, the other person need to manually resolve the conflict before the changes can be merged together. 

Task 3: Working on multiple branches

When people are working on copies of the master file in different branches, they won't have any conflict until the point when they try to merge their respective changes of one file into the master branch.

Task 4: Both users are on different branches

When people are working on copies of the repo on different branches, if they don't modify the same file, no conflict will be detected when they merge their changes to the master branch.

Task 5: Both users are on different branches with conflcits

When people are working on copies of the repo on different branches, if they modify the same file, they need resolve the conflicts manually when all the changes are merged to the master branch.
